This is puzzle game in which the user uses puzzle pieces to fill an object. 
It was build based on JavFX and Java 1.8 required for running it.

About work distribution:
We discussed about this project frequently and made all the decisions all together. 

basically all the individual works can be checked on Github. 


But for Erming Gao. He has some pull/push problem in the first so some of the codes from him is posted by Hao Chen.

Also Erming Gao is responsible for the layout design, buttons design, coordinates part and all the images/buttons. 
It was easier to sent these resource files to other team members by email and assemble them into the codes.
